This is created as a Flutter Web project, so you can play around with the design and help me find bugs.<br>

## Packages:

- No packages were used

<br>

I took a challenge to not use any package, and I did it.<br>
Finally a working [RadialGestureDetector](https://github.com/mslalith/flutter_dial_login/blob/master/lib/widgets/radial_gesture_detector.dart).<br>
But in my opinion, there are still some optimizations and a better approach to implement this design.<br>
If possible, fork this repo and send a PR.

You can support me by buying me a coffee.
